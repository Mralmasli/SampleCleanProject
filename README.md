# SampleCleanProject

## - Clean Architecture

### What is clean architecture?
Architecture means the overall design of the project. It's the organization of the code into classes or files or components or modules. And it's how all these groups of code relate to each other. The architecture defines where the application performs its core functionality and how that functionality interacts with things like the database and the user interface.

### Layers
- **Domain** - Would execute business logic which is independent of any layer and is just a pure kotlin/java package with no android specific dependency.
- **Data** - Would dispense the required data for the application to the domain layer by implementing interface exposed by the domain.
- **Presentation / framework** - Would include both domain and data layer and is android specific which executes the UI logic.
